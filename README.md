This repo serves as a place to put the templates and pages that will eventually make up my portfolio / blog / youtube site.

At this time, the main template for the landing page is done.

You can open your browser, and look at it if you like.

Once these pages and templates are complete, they will be chopped up into base component parts and put in a static site generator.

I'm thinking Metalsmith or Jekyll might do the job.
